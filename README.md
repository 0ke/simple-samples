# Electron Samples

Sample Electron applications with ideas for taking them further.

This repository is meant as a tool for learning Electron by taking an
existing application further by using additional Electron APIs.

Each folder contains a different app with the `README.md` in that folder
explaining what it does, how to run it, and how it could be improved.
