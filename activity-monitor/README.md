# Activity Monitor

Simple [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) application that shows a
doughnut chart of the CPU system, user, and idle activity time.

## Getting started

- Install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org)
- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install` from the root of the repository
- Run` npm start` to launch the application

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other Electron APIs.

- Make it live update every X number of seconds
- Add tooltips that show times in hours/day instead of milliseconds
- Support exporting CPU times to a comma-separated (.csv) file
- Support saving chart as PNG
- Support printing chart
